## SLIDE 2: The Problem

**Small businesses lose 62% of inbound leads**

- Missed calls go to voicemail (customers don't leave messages)
- Text messages get buried or forgotten
- Emails pile up unanswered
- Website visitors leave without converting
- After-hours inquiries go cold overnight

**Every missed message = lost revenue**

## SLIDE 3: The Old Way vs. The ConvoPro Way

| The Old Way | The ConvoPro Way |
|-------------|------------------|
| Voicemail nobody checks | AI answers every call |
| Texts you forget to reply to | Instant AI responses 24/7 |
| Email inbox chaos | Smart lead capture |
| "We'll call you back" (you won't) | Real conversations, real-time |
| Hiring staff to answer phones | AI that never calls in sick |
